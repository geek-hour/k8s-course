## Main Content of the Course

Many people's first impression of Kubernetes is that it has too many components, a steep learning curve, and high learning costs.

However, Kubernetes is indeed an excellent container orchestration system.

Its emergence has solved many problems of container orchestration, making container orchestration simpler, more efficient, and reliable.

This course will guide you to quickly get started with Kubernetes, allowing you to quickly grasp the basic concepts and usage methods of Kubernetes within an hour.

The CheatSheet in the course is under the doc directory of this repository, and everyone is welcome to download and use it.
